When deploying the code, two modifications need to be made based on the actual setup:

    Line 62: The model path should be adjusted according to the actual location.
    Line 72: The trained policy should be modified based on its actual location.

In my code, the model is placed in /localhost, and a JSZR folder is created inside the Robots directory to store the model.
Similarly, the .pt file follows the same approach.

After deployment, you can replace the policy in the Isaac Sim quadruped robot example to evaluate its performance.
